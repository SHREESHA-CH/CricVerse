CricVerse cricket chatbot using FastAPI, combining traditional data lookup with modern AI models for conversational intelligence. You began by preparing and cleaning a CSV dataset (batting_stats_cleaned.csv) containing player statistics like runs, matches, and averages. Then, you used a SentenceTransformer model to generate vector embeddings for each player entry and stored them in a FAISS index, enabling semantic similarity search—so the system could find players even from partial or misspelled names. You loaded all essential components globally for efficiency, including the SentenceTransformer model, FAISS index, the dataset, and two transformer pipelines — BERT (for question understanding) and FLAN-T5 (for conversational rephrasing). You then created a FastAPI app with a /predict endpoint, where the user’s query is processed: it detects player names, identifies intent (like runs, matches, averages, centuries, etc.), retrieves relevant stats from the dataset, and rephrases the answer in a friendly, chat-like tone. You also added conversation memory to remember the last player discussed, ensuring natural follow-up questions. Finally, you enabled CORS for frontend integration and tested the API using uvicorn, completing an intelligent, context-aware, and conversational cricket chatbot backend.  i have done all this. should i finetune my model so that it will give more appropriate responses
